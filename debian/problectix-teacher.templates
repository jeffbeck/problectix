Description: Setting $TEXINPUTS system wide
 $TEXINPUTS contains a path where TEX and LATEX look for files
 that are included by \input{file}
 and other commands. 
 .
 You can set the environment Variable $TEXINPUTS system wide  
 if you put this line into /etc/profile:
 .
 . /usr/share/problectix-teacher/problectix.bash
 .
 This has to be done manually by you.
 .
 TEX/LATEX will then look in ~/mytex and subdirectories for files
